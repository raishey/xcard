Below is a comprehensive README for the XCard project based on your description. It assumes the project is the Go-based service for launching games on a MiSTer FPGA, adapted to handle XCard storage formats. If you meant XCard as a standalone specification or a different implementation, let me know, and I can adjust it!
XCard
XCard is a Go-based service for the MiSTer FPGA that manages and launches games stored in the XCard storage format. The XCard format is designed to organize a set of related files (e.g., ROMs, assets) and their metadata within a folder or volume, described by a manifest file. This service allows MiSTer users to launch games from XCard folders, leveraging metadata for enhanced presentation and configuration, such as menu names, marquee bitmaps, controller settings, and screen filters.
Features
XCard Format Support: Reads a manifest file in an XCard folder to identify and manage game files and metadata.
Game Launching: Launches games on MiSTer FPGA by interfacing with the system's core-loading mechanism.
Metadata Handling: Supports optional metadata like:
Display names for menus or screens.
Marquee definitions for bitmap display.
Controller configurations.
Preferred screen filters.
Systemd Service: Runs as a background service on MiSTer, enabling automatic or triggered game launches.
Extensible: Easily adaptable for additional metadata or MiSTer-specific features.
XCard Format
The XCard format is a folder or volume containing:
Game Files: ROMs, assets, or other files required by an FPGA core (e.g., .nes, .sfc).
Manifest File: A file (e.g., manifest.json) describing the contents and metadata.
Manifest Example
json
{
  "name": "Super Mario Bros",
  "core": "NES",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "SuperMario.nes",
      "type": "rom"
    },
    {
      "path": "cover.png",
      "type": "asset"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "display_name": "Super Mario Bros (NES)",
    "marquee": {
      "bitmap_path": "marquee.png",
      "width": 320,
      "height": 32
    },
    "controller": {
      "type": "nes",
      "mapping": {
        "a": "button1",
        "b": "button2"
      }
    },
    "screen_filter": "scanlines"
  }
}
name: Internal identifier.
core: Target FPGA core (e.g., NES, SNES).
files: List of files with paths and types.
metadata: Optional data for display, marquee, controllers, or filters.
Prerequisites
Go: Version 1.16 or higher for development and compilation.
MiSTer FPGA: Running a Linux-based OS with systemd (standard MiSTer setup).
Storage: SD card with XCard folders at /media/fat/xcards/ (configurable).
Access: SSH or physical access to MiSTer for deployment.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xcard.git
cd xcard
Build the Binary:
Cross-compile for MiSTer’s ARM architecture:
bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build -o xcard
Deploy to MiSTer:
Copy the binary to MiSTer:
bash
scp xcard root@<mister-ip>:/usr/local/bin/
Set Up XCard Folders:
Place XCard folders (each with a manifest.json and game files) in /media/fat/xcards/. Example:
/media/fat/xcards/SuperMario/
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── SuperMario.nes
  ├── cover.png
  └── marquee.png
Configure systemd Service:
Create /etc/systemd/system/xcard.service on MiSTer:
ini
[Unit]
Description=XCard Game Launcher Service for MiSTer FPGA
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/xcard -xcard /media/fat/xcards/SuperMario
Restart=always
User=root
Group=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Replace /media/fat/xcards/SuperMario with your XCard folder path.
Remove Restart=always if the service should run once and exit.
Enable and start the service:
bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable xcard
systemctl start xcard
Usage
Launch a Game: The service launches the game specified in the XCard manifest when started. To launch a different game, update the ExecStart line in xcard.service with a new -xcard path and restart:
bash
systemctl restart xcard
Check Status: View service logs:
bash
journalctl -u xcard
Command-Line: Run manually for testing:
bash
/usr/local/bin/xcard -xcard /media/fat/xcards/SuperMario
Command-Line Flags
-xcard <path>: Path to the XCard folder (default: /media/fat/xcards/default).
Development
To extend or modify the service:
Edit main.go:
Add support for new metadata (e.g., audio settings).
Implement core-switching logic if needed.
Enhance error handling or logging.
Rebuild and Deploy:
bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build -o xcard
scp xcard root@<mister-ip>:/usr/local/bin/
Test:
Ensure the XCard folder is correctly formatted.
Verify game launching with systemctl status xcard.
Example Code Overview
The service:
Reads the manifest.json from the specified XCard folder.
Validates the game file (e.g., ROM) and core.
Launches the game by writing the ROM path to MiSTer’s trigger file (e.g., /media/fat/load_fpga) or executing a script.
Logs actions for debugging.
Key files:
main.go: Core logic for parsing XCard manifests and launching games.
xcard.service: Systemd configuration.

Notes
Repository: Replace https://github.com/yourusername/xcard.git with your actual repo URL or remove if not hosted yet.
Manifest Path: I assumed /media/fat/xcards/ for XCard folders, but you can specify a different path if MiSTer uses another convention.
MiSTer Integration: The README assumes the game-launching mechanism from your previous question (writing to a trigger file). If XCard requires specific MiSTer scripts or sockets, I can update the code and README.
Metadata: The example manifest includes marquee, controller, and filter metadata. If XCard has a formal spec, share it, and I’ll align the format precisely.
If you want to refine the README (e.g., add a logo, specify XCard’s formal spec, or include build badges), let me know!
